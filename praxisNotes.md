### Mapping in the Digital Humanities
### October 26, 2016


## Introduction 

- What is a map? What makes it different from other types of visualizations?

## Framing Activity 

- In groups of 3-4, analyze one of these maps. Play around with it, spend time learning about it.
	- What do you like, what do you dislike?
	- What features stand out?
	- What is the story being told?
	- What decisions did the cartographer have to make to tell that story?
	- Would you have made different decisions? Why?

### Map Terms

- Raster - Representation of the world with few points tying it to the real world, limited scalability.
- Vector - Each point and object is scaled to real things in the world. Consist of many geo-referenced locations with all points, lines, and polygons scaled to match.
	- NYPL Rectifying Project: [Map Warper](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/)
- Tiles - Vector tiles allow zooming without having to re-render the entire map. Consist of many many layers
